# messenger_automation
So you need not send message messages on messenger by typing now you can make your own messenger bot by just 6 lines of python code!!
I have done it by using Pycharm which is an python code editor.
In the first I have opened the terminal and written **pip install pyautogui**.
Then at the first I have imported pyautogui.
Then I have imported time.
Then I have written while True: and inside this I have written pyautogui.typewrite('THE MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEND'). then to look like you are typing it It will take 3 seconds so I have written time.slpeep(3) and then at the last to send the message I have written pyautogui.press('enter').
And now your messenger bot is ready now you need not type messages lots of messages in messenger!!
